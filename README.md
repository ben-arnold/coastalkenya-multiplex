Scripts to conduct analyses for a multiplex antibody study collected in coastal Kenya in 2015


### Description
This repository includes analysis scripts written in R to summarize age-dependent and overall mean antibody levels and seroprevalence in 10 coastal communities in Kenya. Measurements were collected in 2015. We will update this repository as soon as the related manuscript is through peer review. Should you have any questions about these files, please contact Ben Arnold at UC Berkeley (benarnold@berkeley.edu).
